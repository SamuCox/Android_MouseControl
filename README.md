An Android application which uses sockets to control the mouse cursor on your PC. 

- Connect both devices on the same WiFi network
- Find the server IP address on your PC, and change the constant
- Run a separate java file on your "server" before running the Android app. This file uses the Robot class to interpret inputs from the Android device
- Wait for connection and you should have control of the mouse cursor on screen
